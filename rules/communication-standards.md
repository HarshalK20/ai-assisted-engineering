# Communication Standards

This document defines standards for technical communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement.

## Executive Communication

### Pyramid Principle

Structure all executive communications top-down:
1. **Lead with the answer** - Don't build suspense
2. **Support with grouped arguments** - 3-5 key points maximum
3. **Each point stands alone** - Executive can stop reading at any level

### Executive Summary Format

```markdown
# [Initiative Name]

## Problem
[What's wrong or needed - one paragraph]

## Solution
[What we're doing - one paragraph]

## Impact
• [Business outcome 1]
• [Business outcome 2]
• [Business outcome 3]

## Decision Required
[Specific approval request with deadline]
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **Lead with impact**: Start with why it matters to business
- **Quantify everything**: "70% faster" not "much faster"
- **Use business language**: Translate technical terms
- **Be concise**: < 300 words for summaries, < 1 page for proposals
- **Include ROI**: Cost vs benefit with timeline

### Translation Table

| Technical Term | Executive Translation |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Refactor the codebase" | "Reduce technical debt to improve feature velocity 2x" |
| "Add monitoring" | "Improve visibility to prevent outages costing $X/hour" |
| "Upgrade framework" | "Maintain security compliance and vendor support" |
| "Optimize queries" | "Reduce infrastructure costs by 40% ($Y/year)" |

## Presentation Standards

### Slide Structure

Every slide must have:
1. **Headline = Key Message** - The takeaway is the title
2. **One clear point** - If can't summarize in one sentence, split it
3. **Supporting evidence** - Data, examples, or logic
4. **Visual hierarchy** - Most important info largest/boldest

### Decision Deck Format

```
Slide 1: Title - What we're deciding
Slide 2: Context - Why this matters now
Slide 3: Problem - What's not working
Slide 4: Options - Max 3 alternatives
Slide 5: Recommendation - Our choice + rationale
Slide 6: Impact - Quantified business value
Slide 7: Implementation - Timeline and phases
Slide 8: Next Steps - Specific decision needed
```

### Visual Guidelines

- **Max 6 lines** of body text per slide
- **Max 6 words** per bullet (ideal)
- **One chart/visual** per slide maximum
- **Consistent terminology** - Don't switch terms
- **No jargon** (or explain on first use)

## Error Message Standards

### User-Facing Errors

Every error message should:
1. **Explain what happened** - Clear, specific description
2. **Explain why** - Context (if helpful)
3. **Explain what to do** - Specific next action

Format: `[What]. [Why]. [Action].`

Example:
```
Bad: "Error 403"
Good: "Access denied. Your account doesn't have permission to view this page. Contact your admin to request access."
```

### Error Message Principles

- **Be human**: Write for users, not developers
- **Be specific**: "Email is required" not "Validation error"
- **Be actionable**: Always include next step
- **Be empathetic**: Don't blame user

### Error Severity

```markdown
**Info** (FYI):
"Your session will expire in 5 minutes"

**Warning** (Action recommended):
"Storage is 90% full. Consider deleting old files"

**Error** (Action required):
"Password is required. Please enter your password"

**Critical** (Blocking, urgent):
"Account locked due to suspicious activity. Contact support immediately"
```

## Documentation Standards

### README Structure

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description (one paragraph)

## Quick Start
```bash
# Commands to get started
```

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Installation
[Detailed setup]

## Usage
[Common use cases]

## Configuration
[Environment variables, config files]

## Development
[How to contribute, run tests]

## Deployment
[How to deploy]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues and solutions]

## License
```

### API Documentation

Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs:
- Document all endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document all error codes
- Version documentation with API

### Code Comments

```markdown
**When to comment**:
- Complex algorithms (why, not what)
- Non-obvious behavior
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- TODOs with ticket references

**When NOT to comment**:
- Obvious code (name explains it)
- Autogenerated sections
- Version history (use git)
```

### Comment Style

```python
# Good: Explains WHY
# Use binary search for O(log n) performance with large datasets
result = binary_search(array, target)

# Bad: Explains WHAT (obvious)
# Loop through users
for user in users:
```

## Release Notes & Changelogs

### Format

```markdown
# Version X.Y.Z - Date

## Overview
[One paragraph: What shipped and primary value]

## User Impact

### New Features
• [Feature] - [User benefit]

### Improvements
• [What improved] - [Benefit]

### Bug Fixes
• [What was fixed] - [How it helps]

## System Impact

### Performance
• [Metric] improved by X%

### Reliability
• [Improvement]

## Breaking Changes
• [Change] - [Migration path]
```

### Writing Guidelines

- Focus on impact, not activity
- Use concrete metrics
- Translate technical to user terms
- Group related changes
- Include migration guides for breaking changes

## Stakeholder-Specific Communication

Impact: [Who is affected and how]
Started: [Time]

What happened:
[Clear description of symptoms]

Current actions:
[What we're doing now]

Next update: [Time]
```

### Post-Incident

```markdown
**Post-Mortem Template**:

# [Incident Title] - Post-Mortem

## Impact
Duration: X hours
Affected users: Y% or count
Revenue impact: $Z or none
SLA status: Met/Breached

## Root Cause
[One sentence technical + business impact]

## Timeline
HH:MM - [Event]
HH:MM - [Event]

## Resolution
[What fixed it]

## Prevention
- Short-term (this week): [Action]
- Medium-term (this month): [Action]
- Long-term (this quarter): [Investment]

## Lessons Learned
[Top 3 systemic insights]
```

## Meeting Communication

### Meeting Preparation

Before scheduling:
- **Agenda**: What will be discussed
- **Goal**: What decision/outcome
- **Pre-read**: Materials to review
- **Attendees**: Who needs to be there

### Meeting Notes

```markdown
# Meeting: [Title] - [Date]

**Attendees**: [Names]
**Goal**: [Objective]

## Decisions
1. [Decision] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Action] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

## Discussion Notes
[Key points, not transcript]

## Next Steps
[What happens next]
```

## Code Review Comments

### Conventional Comments

Prefix comments with type:
- `praise:` - Positive feedback
- `nitpick:` - Minor issue (optional)
- `suggestion:` - Consider this approach
- `issue:` - Must fix
- `question:` - Need clarification
- `thought:` - Observation

### Feedback Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines
- **Be constructive**: Suggest solutions
- **Be clear**: Explain why (if not obvious)
- **Be kind**: Respectful tone
- **Prioritize**: Mark critical vs optional

## Accessibility in Communication

- **Alt text** for images
- **Captions** for videos
- **Plain language** (avoid jargon)
- **Clear headings** (scannable)
- **Link text** descriptive (not "click here")
- **Color contrast** (WCAG AA minimum)

## Internationalization

- **Simple language**: Translates better
- **Avoid idioms**: "Oops!" → "Error"
- **Date/time format**: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Currency**: Explicit (USD, EUR)
- **Numbers**: Locale-aware formatting

## Templates & Examples
